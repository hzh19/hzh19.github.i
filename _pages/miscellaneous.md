I enjoy a variety of sports, epecially middle-distance and long-distance running. I placed 3rd in the Women’s 800m and 4th in Women’s 1500m in annual sport meet on campus. I also finished in the top 30 out of thousands of participants in the Tsinghua University Mini Marathon (4.2km) and Campus Marathon (10km).

I was the class leader of Yao Class 91 during my sophomore year.

My roommates <a href="https://ziqing-huang.github.io/">Ziqing Huang</a> (NLP), <a href="https://wmdi.github.io/">Mengdi Wu</a> (computer systems and compilers) and <a href="https://tu-yaxin.github.io/">Yaxin Tu</a> (theory) are also outstanding researchers in their areas. They are a great part of my undergraduate experience!
