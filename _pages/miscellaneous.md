I enjoy a variety of sports, epecially middle-distance and long-distance running. I placed 3rd in the Women’s 800m and 4th in Women’s 1500m in annual sport meet on campus. I also finished in the top 30 out of thousands of participants in the Tsinghua University Mini Marathon (4.2km) and Campus Marathon (10km).

I have some basic proficiency in playing the piano.

I love using my camera :camera: to capture moments from my daily life. Click [here](../blog) to see some pictures.
