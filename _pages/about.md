I recently completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/) (known as [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/)), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). I am currently in my gap year due to visa issues.

My research interests lie in <b>theoretical computer science</b>, especially cryptography.

During my undergraduate, I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yilei Chen](http://www.chenyilei.net/).

During the Spring and Summer of 2022, I had the privilege to work under the supervision of [Prof. Prabhanjan Ananth](https://sites.google.com/site/prabhanjanva) and [Prof. Henry Yuen](http://www.henryyuen.net/).
